# pandas-challenge

In this assignment, I have created and manipulated Pandas DataFrames to analyze school scores and budgets data and showcase trends in school performance.

I've been asked to analyze the district-wide standardized test results. In [Resources](PyCitySchools/Resources) are the inicial datasets with every student's math and reading scores, as well as various information on the schools they attend.

### District Summary

I have created a high-level snapshot, in a DataFrame, of the district's key metrics, including the following:

* Total schools
* Total students
* Total budget
* Average math score
* Average reading score
* % passing math (the percentage of students who passed math)
* % passing reading (the percentage of students who passed reading)
* % overall passing (the percentage of students who passed math AND reading)

### School Summary

I have created a DataFrame that summarizes key metrics about each school, including the following:

* School name
* School type
* Total students
* Total school budget
* Per student budget
* Average math score
* Average reading score
* % passing math (the percentage of students who passed math)
* % passing reading (the percentage of students who passed reading)
* % overall passing (the percentage of students who passed math AND reading)

### Highest-Performing Schools (by % Overall Passing)

I have created a DataFrame that highlights the top 5 performing schools based on % Overall Passing. Including the following metrics:

* School name
* School type
* Total students
* Total school budget
* Per student budget
* Average math score
* Average reading score
* % passing math (the percentage of students who passed math)
* % passing reading (the percentage of students who passed reading)
* % overall passing (the percentage of students who passed math AND reading)


### Lowest-Performing Schools (by % Overall Passing)

I have created a DataFrame that highlights the bottom 5 performing schools based on % Overall Passing. Including:

* School name
* School type
* Total students
* Total school budget
* Per student budget
* Average math score
* Average reading score
* % passing math (the percentage of students who passed math)
* % passing reading (the percentage of students who passed reading)
* % overall passing (the percentage of students who passed math AND reading)

### Math Scores by Grade

I have created a DataFrame that lists the average math score for students of each grade level (9th, 10th, 11th, 12th) at each school.

### Reading Scores by Grade

I have created a DataFrame that lists the average reading score for students of each grade level (9th, 10th, 11th, 12th) at each school.

### Scores by School Spending

I have created a table that breaks down school performance based on average spending ranges (per student). Including the following metrics in the table:

* Average math score
* Average reading score
* % passing math (the percentage of students who passed math)
* % passing reading (the percentage of students who passed reading)
* % overall passing (the percentage of students who passed math AND reading)

### Scores by School Size

I have created a table that breaks down school performance based on school size (small, medium, or large).

### Scores by School Type

I have created a table that breaks down school performance based on type of school (district or charter).
